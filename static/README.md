## Installation
#### Prebuilt release
Latest Release: [https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg/releases](https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg/releases)

Latest Daily Build: [https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg-DailyBuild/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg-DailyBuild/archive/master.zip)

#### Building from source
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](https://bower.io/) installed. Then download the source code, and follow these steps.

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ gulp clean build

The builds will be placed in the dist directory.

#### Usage Notes
Since AriaNg loads language resources asynchronously, you may not open index.html directly on the local file system to run AriaNg. It is recommended that you deploy AriaNg in a web container or download [AriaNg Native](https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg-Native) that does not require a browser to run.
